# Getting-started-with-python
Mini projects on python to learn and understand better.

### Firstly, get to know about, "What is python?".                                       

## Python                                               

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.

### Now that we know what python is, let's move on to the libraries in python.

## Python libraries

A Python library is a collection of modules that are related to one another. It includes code bundles that may be reused in several apps. It simplifies and facilitates Python programming for the programmer. Because we don't have to write the same code for multiple projects. Python libraries are extremely important in domains such as machine learning, data science, data visualisation, and so on.
Let’s have a look at some of the commonly used libraries:

1.TensorFlow: This library was developed by Google in collaboration with the Brain Team. It is an open-source library used for high-level computations. It is also used in machine learning and deep learning algorithms. It contains a large number of tensor operations.

2.Matplotlib: This library is responsible for plotting numerical data. And that’s why it is used in data analysis. It is also an open-source library and plots high-defined figures like pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, graphs, etc.

3.Pandas: Pandas are an important library for data scientists. It is an open-source machine learning library that provides flexible high-level data structures and a variety of analysis tools. It eases data analysis, data manipulation, and cleaning of data. Pandas support operations like Sorting, Re-indexing, Iteration, Concatenation, Conversion of data, Visualizations, Aggregations, etc.

4.Numpy: The name “Numpy” stands for “Numerical Python”. It is the commonly used library. It is a popular machine learning library that supports large matrices and multi-dimensional data. It consists of in-built mathematical functions for easy computations. 

5.SciPy: The name “SciPy” stands for “Scientific Python”. It is an open-source library used for high-level scientific computations. This library is built over an extension of Numpy. It works with Numpy to handle complex computations. 

6.Scrapy: It is an open-source library that is used for extracting data from websites. It provides very fast web crawling and high-level screen scraping. It can also be used for data mining and automated testing of data.

7.Scikit-learn: It is a famous Python library to work with complex data. Scikit-learn is an open-source library that supports machine learning. It supports variously supervised and unsupervised algorithms like linear regression, classification, clustering, etc. 

8.PyTorch: PyTorch is the largest machine learning library that optimizes tensor computations. It has rich APIs to perform tensor computations with strong GPU acceleration. It also helps to solve application issues related to neural networks.

There are many more libraries in Python. We can use a suitable library for our purposes. Hence, Python libraries play a very crucial role and are very helpful to the developers.

#### With python we can do so many cool stuffs. It makes the program look super easy to understand.              I have shown very few programs here to make you understand a little better.
